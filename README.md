What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
I learned the importance of organizing my files properly (ex. naming the homepage index.html 
and placing it in the root directory) to ensure smooth deployment. It also helped me gain
more hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, including version control and committing changes,
which are crucial for managing code in collaborative environment.
